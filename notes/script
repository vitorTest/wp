I made a very dumb script, that remove a folder and then copy from
another folder and copy the content of that...

I wanted to work with the Wordpress theme only, in the /wp-content/themes/
and don't wanted to create a repository for each theme... So I
find more easy, "update" it myself... 

There are some ways to do it with git, but they are very ugly.
I'm repeating code, but I think nobody is going to complain :)

Maybe I could do a better script comparing a hash of each file, and
updating only the ones that are different. And work with some variables
for the script not own that path wrote in absolute.

But this is not the focuses in here, so I don't mind in improve that.
Inside the theme folder there is an 'updater.sh', ugly but works for while.
