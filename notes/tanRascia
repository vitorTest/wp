|-- Basic Setting ---------------------------------------------------------------------|

- Work under LAMP
- /var/www/

- /etc/apache2/
	|-- apache2.conf
	|       `--  ports.conf
	|-- mods-enabled
	|       |-- *.load
	|       `-- *.conf
	|-- conf-enabled
	|       `-- *.conf
	|-- sites-enabled
	|       `-- *.conf

Apache2 runs as www-data by default, so
	> sudo chown vitor:www-data /var/www/html

Install MySQL
	> sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server
I don't used the secure_installation

Install PHP and Modules
	> sudo apt-get install php7.2 php7.2-mysql libapache2-mod-php7.2 php7.2-cli php7.2-cgi php7.2-gd

Create WordPress Database
	>  mysql -u root -p

!!! Mysql by default has root user's authentication plugin as auth_socket, 
	which requires the system user name and db user name to be the same. 

!!! So I'll to create another user with the old pattern vitor:changeit123
	> # mysql -u root -p
	> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	
Login with new user, and create the database
	> mysql -u username -p
	> CREATE DATABASE wp_bd;

It's time to edit wp-config.php.
Tha basic set is to change DB_NAME, DB_USER and the DB_PASSWORD.

For sure restart the services
	> sudo systemctl restart apache2.service 
	> sudo systemctl restart mysql.service

!!! Error establishing a database connection.
!!! I already have configurated all permitions. I'll try to install phpmyadmin.

	> sudo add-apt-repository universe

Now is the time to install phpMyAdmin.
	> sudo apt update
	> sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-gettext

!!! loscalhost/phpadmin is not working.
!!! Including PHPMyAdmin inside apache configuration, in '/etc/apache2/apache.conf',
	> Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

I just wrote de DB_NAME wrong... The name was wp_bd and I was trying
to access wp_db... Stupidity number 1920392493029439459394. Sorry mom.

Now I'm going to copy the files from tanRascia to '/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/themes'.
